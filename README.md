# Tip-discount-thing
first java project i made, released dopamine and decided to release it here lol
basically what it does it:

- you add the amount of said product you wish to buy (via user-input)
- add tax/tip
- and there is also a discount system lol
simply type in amount of said product (in this case this product is 5.00 dollars)
and you will get a output that calculates the discount and tax/tip rates
